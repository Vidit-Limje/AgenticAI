🧠 Agentic AI Financial Advisor (LangGraph + Open-Source LLM)

An agentic AI–based financial advisory system built using LangGraph and LangChain, powered by an open-source large language model (Mistral-7B-Instruct).
The system simulates a multi-agent investment advisory workflow, where each agent specializes in a distinct financial reasoning task and collaborates via a shared state.
